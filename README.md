# Full Stack Open 2022

I use this repository to save exercise of the Full Stack open course of the University of Helsinki.

This is from the 2020/2021/2022 edition, wich can be accessed for free on the [Full Stack Open course website](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

Description :
Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

From part 6 I use branches to manage  exercises. The previous way was highly inefficient. The frontend and backend of the apps of the previous parts are available in their corresponding branches (notes and blogs).
